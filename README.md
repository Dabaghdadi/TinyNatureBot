# TinyNatureBot

([@tinynaturebot](https://twitter.com/tinynaturebot))
a twitter bot that tweets out tiny bits of nature every hour

<h3>some cool details about the bot:</h3>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">each tweet has randomly determined:</span>

1. weather (clear/rain/thunder/snow)

2. time (day/night)

3. habitat (forests, beach, flower fields)


if it's day time, a random set of clouds are placed, and if it is night time, it places stars instead of clouds

theres also several rare events, such as comets showing up at night, beaches, or even sunflower fields

<i>i hope you got what you're looking for whether it was to learn about my bot, how to set up a bot, or whatever</i>  :)
