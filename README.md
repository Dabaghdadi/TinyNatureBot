<h3>some cool details about the bot:</h3>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">each tweet has randomly determined:</span>

1. 🌧️ weather (clear/rain/thunder/snow)

2. ☀ time (day/night)

3. 🌲 habitat (forests, beach, flower fields)

- if ☀ time, random ☁s are placed
- if 🌕 time, place random ⭐s

theres also several rare events, such as comets showing up at night, beaches, or even sunflower fields
